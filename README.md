# Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) used while designing of Assembler and Simulator:
# For Assembler: <br/>
Program an assembler for the aforementioned ISA and assembly. 
The input to the assembler is
a text file containing the assembly instructions. Each line of the text file may be of one of 3
types:
● Empty line: Ignore these lines <br/>
● A label <br/>
● An instruction <br/>
● A variable definition <br/>
Each of these entities have the following grammar: <br/>
● The syntax of all the supported instructions is given above. The fields of an instruction are
whitespace separated. The instruction itself might also have whitespace before it. An
instruction can be one of the following: <br/>
● The opcode must be one of the supported mnemonic. <br/>
● A register can be one of R0, R1, ... R6, and FLAGS. <br/>
● A mem_addr in jump instructions must be a label. <br/>
● A Imm must be a whole number <= 255 and >= 0. <br/>
● A mem_addr in load and store must be a variable. <br/>
● A label marks a location in the code and must be followed by a colon (:). No spaces are
allowed between label name and colon(:) <br/>
● A variable definition is of the following format: <br/>
var xyz <br/>
which declares a 16 bit variable called xyz. This variable name can be used in place of
mem_addr fields in load and store instructions. All variables must be defined at the
very beginning of the assembly program. <br/>
Example of an assembly program <br/>
var X <br/>
mov R1 $10 <br/>
mov R2 $100 <br/>
mul R3 R1 R2 <br/>
st R3 X <br/>
hlt <br/>
The above program will be converted into the following machine code: <br/>
1001000100001010 <br/>
1001001001100100 <br/>
1011000011001010 <br/>
1010101100000101 <br/>
0101000000000000 <br/>

# For Simulator: <br/>
You need to write a simulator for the given ISA. The input to the simulator is a binary file (the
format is the same as the format of the binary file generated by the assembler in Q1. The
simulator should load the binary in the system memory at the beginning, and then start
executing the code at address 0. The code is executed until hlt is reached. After execution of
each instruction, the simulator should output one line containing an 8 bit number denoting the
program counter. This should be followed by 8 space separated 16 bit binary numbers denoting
the values of the registers (R0, R1, ... R6 and FLAGS). <br/>
<PC (8 bits)><space><R0 (16 bits)><space>...<R6 (16 bits)><space><FLAGS (16 bits)>.
The output must be written to stdout. Similarly, the input must be read from stdin. After the
program is halted, print the memory dump of the whole memory. This should be 256 lines, each
having a 16 bit value.
